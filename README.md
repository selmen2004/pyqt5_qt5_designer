## Introduction 

This package is designed for two reasons :

1- Remove the necessity of installing the whole pyqt5_tools packages to be able to use designer , ignoring some problems in pip versioning (on windows)

2- Providing a minimalist package to run Qt5 Designer( less than 1MB ) that relies on existing pyqt5 bin files 


## Installation

```console
pip install pyqt5_qt5_designer
```
